# Home-budget-app

The application was made as part of the spring boot framework learning.

## Summary

The application was supposed to be a simple implementation of JWT authorization/authentication, but it has evolved into a simple budget management app. In API you can:
- register user,
- login,
- add incoming or outgoing transactions,
- create an account (card),
- delete account (card),
- reset password ( new password coming on e-mail),
- change password,
- get all transactions or get the sum by month and category,
